README
------------------------------

Instructions for deploying:
Simply deploy the app using the google app engine (appcfg.py)

 The datastoreviewer.py (and .html) in the handlers folder is not necessary for
 this web app to function but is provided to let you see the contents of
 the datastore without giving you admin access.

------------------------------

Instructions on using:

at /:

1. Enter the user account
2. Enter an OAuth2 token, make sure the scope includes https://sites.google.com
3. Enter the domain of the site, examples:
  for 'https://sites.google.com/site/techtipstuesday' enter 'site'
  for 'https://sites.google.com/a/cloudspokes.com/home' enter 'cloudspokes.com'

assuming you inputted a valid oauth token you will be redirected to /site_select

at /site_select:
 The choices are site names, examples:
  for 'https://sites.google.com/site/techtipstuesday' it is 'techtipstuesday'
  for 'https://sites.google.com/a/cloudspokes.com/home' it is 'home'
 You could also specify the site name yourself i.e. if you do not have
 special access to that google site
 
at /inventory:
 Just a message that your request is being processed (using task queues).
 Go to the link for viewing the datastore.
 
at /datastore_viewer:
 Displays the contents of the datastore. If you have requested a site to process,
 wait a few minutes (hours depending on the largeness of the site)
 for the google docs found on that site to appear on the datastore.
